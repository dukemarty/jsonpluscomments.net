## Preserving Meaning: Comment-Aware JSON for Configuration in .NET

### ðŸ“Œ Abstract

JSON is the de facto standard for configuration in many modern applications, especially within the .NET ecosystem, where files like `appsettings.json`. serve as both machine-readable settings and human-readable documentation. However, its lack of native support for comments creates friction for developers who rely on inline documentation to explain configuration intent, usage, and context. So it undermines readability, maintainability, and collaboration.

When applications evolve, configuration files often must be updated â€” usually manually â€” leading to lost comments, overwritten edits, and brittle tooling.

This whitepaper introduces a comment-aware approach to JSON parsing and editing in .NET in form of  *JsonPlusComments.Net*, a comment-aware JSON parser and serializer for .NET that treats comments as first-class citizensâ€”preserving their structure, placement, and meaning throughout the editing lifecycle. Its ultimate goal: enabling migration-aware configuration tooling that respects both the machine and the human.


### Problem Statement

While JSON is machine-friendly and widely adopted, it is notoriously unfriendly to humans when used for configuration (it's not by chance that the standard linux configuration files are more comment than settings). Comments are essential for:

- Explaining the purpose of configuration keys
- Documenting environment-specific values
- Providing guidance for future maintainers

Unfortunately, standard JSON parsers discard comments entirely, leading to:

- Loss of developer intent
- Fragile tooling and brittle diffs
- Reduced maintainability and readability


### Why JSONC Isnâ€™t Enough

JSONC (JSON with Comments) is an informal extension used in some JavaScript tooling, but it lacks a formal specification and robust support in .NET. Most JSONC implementations:

- Are tailored for JavaScript environments
- Strip comments during parsing
- Do not preserve comment placement or formatting

JsonPlusComments.Net goes beyond JSONC by offering a structured, comment-aware approach that integrates seamlessly into .NET workflows.


### Vision & Goals

The goal of JsonPlusComments.Net is to elevate comments from incidental annotations to structured metadata. Key objectives include:

- Preserving comments during parsing, editing, and serialization
- Supporting multiple comment styles (e.g., `//`, `/* */`)
- Enabling safe transformations without losing human context
- Empowering tooling, editors, and CI/CD pipelines to leverage comments meaningfully


### Use Cases

- Annotated configuration files for .NET applications
- DevOps pipelines with environment-specific notes
- JSON templates with embedded guidance for consumers
- Schema-aware editing with comment feedback

### Architecture Overview

JsonPlusComments.Net is built around a custom parser that:

- Tokenizes both data and comments
- Constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) with comment nodes
- Serializes JSON while preserving original layout and comment placement

This architecture enables round-trip editing without loss of information.

### Benefits

- **Improved Maintainability**: Comments clarify intent and reduce onboarding time.
- **Smarter Tooling**: Editors and linters can surface comment-based guidance.
- **Version Control Friendly**: Meaningful diffs that include comment changes.
- **Human-Centric Configuration**: Bridging the gap between machine-readable and human-friendly formats.

### Future Directions

- Visual Studio Code extension for comment-aware editing
- Schema validation with comment-based feedback
- Migration tools from XML or YAML to JSON with comment preservation
- Integration with .NET configuration providers

### Conclusion

JsonPlusComments.Net isnâ€™t just a parserâ€”itâ€™s a philosophy. Configuration should be readable, explainable, and collaborative. Comments arenâ€™t bugs. Theyâ€™re features.
