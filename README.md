# JsonPlusComments.Net

**JsonPlusComments.Net** is a .NET library for parsing, editing, and serializing JSON—with full comment support and zero apologies. Inspired by JSONC, but not bound by it, this library preserves comment structure, position, and formatting like a pro.

Whether you're wrangling config files, building dev tools, or just tired of your JSON being a silent partner, JsonPlusComments.Net lets your data speak human.
