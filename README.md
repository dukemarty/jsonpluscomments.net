# jsonpluscomments.net
JsonPlusComments.Net is a .NET library for parsing, editing, and serializing JSON with full comment support, in some ways not unlike traditional JSONC implementations. The plan is to preserves comment structure, position, and formatting â€” making it ideal for config files, developer tooling, and human-readable data formats.
